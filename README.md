## Project Description
The enitre analysis was produced with the help of the PostgreSQL RDBMS(Relational Database Management System) used for data management and the pgAdmin GUI(Graphical User Interface), which facilitated the interaction with the RDBMS.
The dataset was obtained from kaggle.com. It's important to acknowledge that the overall quality of this analysis heavily depends on the quality of the data.
The project is divided into 2 phases with dedicated files: 
* Data Cleaning: This phase consists of handling missing data and normalization as to ensure minimmum redundancy for an easier and more reliable analysis.
* Exploratory Data Analysis: This phase provides basic statistical metrics for all of the variables and aims to asnwer questions regarding certain aspects of the data.
